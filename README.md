# RAG-Based Document Question Answering System

A full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to upload documents and ask natural language questions. The system retrieves relevant content using vector similarity search and generates accurate answers using a language model.

## Live Demo

## Overview

Traditional language models rely only on pretrained knowledge. This project improves response accuracy by retrieving relevant information directly from uploaded documents before generating answers.

The system workflow:

1. Accept user-uploaded documents
2. Extract and process text
3. Generate vector embeddings
4. Store embeddings in a FAISS vector index
5. Retrieve relevant document chunks
6. Generate answers grounded in retrieved context

This enables context-aware and document-specific question answering.


## Features

- Support for PDF and TXT document uploads
- Intelligent document chunking with overlap
- Embedding generation using SentenceTransformers
- Fast similarity search using FAISS
- Answer generation using:
  - Local Transformer models
  - OpenAI API
- Interactive web interface
- Background document ingestion
- Modular backend architecture

## Retrieval Process

- Documents are divided into approximately 500-character chunks with overlap
- Each chunk is converted into a dense vector embedding
- User queries are embedded into the same vector space
- Similarity search retrieves the most relevant chunks
- The language model generates answers using retrieved context only

### Benefits

- Improved factual accuracy
- Better contextual grounding
- Domain-specific adaptability
- Reduced hallucinations



## Performance Considerations

- Background processing avoids blocking the user interface
- FAISS enables efficient large-scale vector similarity search
- Initial latency mainly comes from model loading
- Architecture designed for scalable document-based AI systems


## Deployment Options

This project can be deployed using:

- Hugging Face Spaces
- Cloud virtual machines
- Containerized FastAPI services
- Render
- Railway


## Use Cases

- Research paper question answering
- Legal and policy document analysis
- Internal company knowledge bases
- Educational assistants
- Resume and report analysis
